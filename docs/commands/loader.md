## Informations

Loader can starts tape file as atmos .tap file by category (demo, games).

Demo, games, tools, music categories displays atmos tape file and Oric-1 tapes files. It means that loader is able to start atmos software only and Oric-1 only.

In order to avoid 2 softwares for Oric-1 and another one for atmos when it's available for theses 2 machines, the choice is that loader displays atmos tape file, and if the software does not exist on the atmos, Oric-1 version is displayed.
