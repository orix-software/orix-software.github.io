# Board Incompatibility

Some oric crashes sometimes with the board. If you have an amplibus (as Silicebit one with 74HCT541), you can plug it in the oric, and insert the expansion board from twilighte board in it, and the twilighte board in this last board.

It should solve all Oric compatibility with the board.
