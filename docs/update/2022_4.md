# v2022.4

## Kernel

* Process structure stores a command line with 60 bytes length (it was 37 bytes before)
* Kernel supports relocation mode binary
* fixbug in multiples files opened

## CC65 (telestrat target)

* binary from cc65 will be deprecated (without relocbin tool in order to convert it in relocation mode). It needs to get relocbin from orix-sdk : https://github.com/assinie/orix-sdk

* cp now works
