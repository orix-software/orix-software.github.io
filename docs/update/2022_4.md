# v2022.4 and v2022.4.1

## Kernel

* Kernel supports relocation mode binary
* fixbug in multiples files opened

## CC65 (telestrat target)

* binary from cc65 will be deprecated (without relocbin tool in order to convert it in relocation mode). It needs to get relocbin from orix-sdk : https://github.com/assinie/orix-sdk

## Shell

* cp now works
* many man pages had been improved
* bugfix with "cd /" which did not work

## How to upgrade

* Download https://repo.orix.oric.org/dists/official/tgz/6502/sdcard.tgz

* gunzip/untar sdcard.tgz on the twilighte board device
* type in the orix shell :
 - cd /usr/share/carts/2022.4

if the default device is a usb key

 - orixcfg -r -s 4 kernelus.r64

if the default device is a sdcard

 - orixcfg -r -s 4 kernelsd.r64
